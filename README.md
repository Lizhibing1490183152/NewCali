The dataset of HSR JR680 robot calibration
The dataset of robot calibration This position data of HSR JR680 robot can be used for robot calibration. We provide NewCali.xlsx with 500 sample points of HSR robot, which can be used for the verification of manipulator calibration algorithm. You can read the following papers to understand the principle and methods of manipulator calibration. Here, L is the length of the cable, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6 are the joint angles of the robot.
